# Djot.erlang

This a parser for John MacFarlane's lightweight markup language [Djot][],
written in native Erlang.
The included test cases are copied directly from [the reference
implementation][djot.js].

[Djot]: https://github.com/jgm/djot
[djot.js]: https://github.com/jgm/djot.js

The parser is currently a work in progress, some features are not
implemented yet and some features are incorrectly implemented.

This is my first (semi-)serious Erlang project, so the code is probably bad
and full of beginner's mistakes. I welcome all constructive comments,
no matter how harsh.

Even though I'm not sure I'll end up regularly using this library,
I'm committing to maintaining it, fixing discovered bugs, following
upstream evolutions of the specification, and improving the code as my
Erlang skill grows. However I will do so on my free time, possibly after
quite some time, as I have other priorities in my life.
