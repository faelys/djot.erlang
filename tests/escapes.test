ASCII punctuation characters can be escaped:

```
\`\*\_\[\#
.
<p>`*_[#</p>
```

Non-ASCII punctuation characters can't be escaped:

```
\a\«
.
<p>\a\«</p>
```

An escaped newline is a hard break:

```
ab\
c
.
<p>ab<br>
c</p>
```

There can be spaces and tabs between the backslash and the newline:

```
ab\	  
c
.
<p>ab<br>
c</p>
```

There can also be spaces and tabs before the backslash, which are ignored:

```
ab 	 \  	
c
.
<p>ab<br>
c</p>
```

An escaped space is a non-breaking space:

```
a\ b
.
<p>a&nbsp;b</p>
```
